        <div class="about1"><p>I'm an aspiring Web Developer based in in my hometown of Vestal, NY, currently enrolled in Bellevue University's Web
            Development cohort. Having grown up during the rise of the internet becoming a central touchstone
            of culture across the world, I suppose it's no surprise that I found myself drawn towards the art of designing
            the ins-and-outs of websites. There's a certain satisfaction to witnessing a completed page or application
            come together from your own efforts, it keeps me eager to pursue my goal of becoming a Full-Stack Developer
            upon graduation.</p>

            <p class="bottom">When I'm not mulling over HTML, JavaScript, and how to get that CSS padding <i>just right</i>, in my spare time, 
                my main hobbies are writing fiction novels that I sure hope are good, going jogging on the local trails (see photo),
                 and playing video games. A few of my favorite games include The Legend of Zelda series, Final Fantasy XIV, and Super 
                 Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p>
