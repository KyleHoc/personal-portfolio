        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I'm an aspiring Web Developer based in in my hometown of Vestal, NY, currently enrolled in Bellevue University's Web
                Development cohort. As someone who grew up during the rise of the internet becoming a central touchstone
                of culture across the world, I suppose it's no surprise that I found myself drawn towards the art of designing
                the ins-and-outs of websites. There's a certain satisfaction to witnessing a completed page or application
                come together from your own efforts, it keeps me eager to pursue my goal of becoming a Fullstack Developer
                upon graduation.

            <p>When I'm not mulling over HTML, JavaScript, and how to get that CSS padding <i>just right</i>, in my spare time, 
                my main hobbies are writing fiction novels that I certainly hope are good, heading out to the local trail to go on a light jog,
                 and playing video games. A few of my favorite games include The Legend of Zelda series, Final Fantasy XIV, and Super 
                 Smash Bros. Ultimate.
