        <p>My name is Kyle Hochdoerfer, I'm a student currently enrolled in Bellevue University's Web Development Program.
            My goal to apply the skills I've been learning and become a Full-Stack Web Developer
            once I graduate. In this portfolio, I've included some personal details about myself along with a resume and
             a number of projects that I've made as part of studies.
